Xbox Game Pass Standard may not be the top choice of subscription for most gamers but how it’s building its catalog now, it will be soon. Of course not having day-one launches was a big downgrade from Console, but the online multiplayer feature, plus an ever growing catalog can win some hearts back.

Every month, Microsoft has consistently added new games to Standard. While most of the time these games are quite “old”, there is still that chance of the newer ones, especially previous day-one launches. And that chance has come as 3 day-one titles have just entered the Standard catalog.


Xbox Game Pass Standard Catalog Update
A total of 4 new games were added today as part of the January wave 1 lineup. These are the Lightyear Frontier, My Time at Sandrock, Robin Hood – Sherwood Builders, and Rolling Hills. Of these four, Lightyear Frontier, Robin Hood – Sherwood Builders, and Rolling Hills entered other tiers of Game Pass on release day. The former was in March and the latter two was in June of 2024. So with two 6-month old games, Standard members aren’t doing bad at all.

This update offers a diverse selection of games, each offering a unique experience within its genre. There’s the peaceful farming sim Lightyear Frontier where you can grow alien crops and explore an otherworldly landscape. There’s also the wholesome crafting and community-focused RPG My Time at Sandrock which blends resource management with storytelling in a post-apocalyptic setting.

Fans of open-world RPGs will also enjoy this month’s edition of Robin Hood – Sherwood Builders. The game combines base-building, exploration, and legendary tales from medieval England. Lastly, Rolling Hills brings a cozy life-simulation twist with its sushi-making robot chef and vibrant village setting, delivering a relaxing yet engaging experience.Microsoft has finally announced the official January wave 1 list for Xbox Game Pass. Apart from Carrion and Road 96 which have already been added to the catalog, six more titles will join in the first half, of which 4 will do today for the Standard tier (Lightyear Frontier, My Time at Sandrock, Robin Hood – Sherwood Builders, and Rolling Hills).

The other two (EA Sports UFC 5 and Diablo) will be on the 14th and will be added for Ultimate and PC Game Pass catalogs
